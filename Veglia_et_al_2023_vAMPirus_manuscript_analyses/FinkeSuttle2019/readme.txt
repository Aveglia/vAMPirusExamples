Hello, in this directory you will find all necessary non-read files used to run the analyses and generate the results described in the vAMPirus manuscript.


These files include:

	1. Finke_Suttle_vAMPirus_manuscript_metadata.csv -> this is the metadata files used for the vAMPirus analysis
	2. Finke_Suttle_vAMPirus_manuscript.config -> the configuration file used for the vAMPirus analysis
	3. uniprot_cyanophageg43.fasta -> cyanophage g43 protein sequences used as the "keep" database in ASV filtering to remove non-cyanophage sequences prior to analysis. Generated by searching uniprot for cyanophage g43 protein sequences and downloading all available.
	4. filter_db.fasta -> non-cyanophage g43 proteins sequences used as the "filter" database in ASV filtering 



To run the same analysis using vAMPirus v2.1.0:

	1. Data should be requested from authors of Finke and Suttle 2019
	2. Edit configuration file paths to metadata and databases (virus refseq) used for taxonomy (can be downloaded using the vAMPirus startup script)
	3. Run vAMPirus with the following launch command (skip commands used to reduce run times; can be removed):
	
		nextflow run vAMPirus.nf -c Finke_Suttle_vAMPirus_manuscript.config -profile conda --Analyze --filter --pcASV -resume --skipPhylogeny --skipReport
